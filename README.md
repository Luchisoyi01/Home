# Simple Dashboard

Open `dashboard.html` in your browser to view the dashboard. No server required — just double-click or use your browser's Open File dialog.

Files:
- `dashboard.html` — main HTML file
- `styles.css` — styling
- `app.js` — small JS for chart and table search

Notes:
- Chart.js is loaded from CDN. If you need an offline copy, download Chart.js and update the script tag in `dashboard.html`.
